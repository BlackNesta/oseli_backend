# Wedding Planner App - Oseli Backend

## Overview
The Wedding Planner App provides couples with a centralized platform to manage every aspect of their wedding. It combines guest list and RSVP tracking, budget control, vendor management, and personalized task planning into a single, easy-to-use tool. 

The concept was inspired by the challenges couples face when relying on spreadsheets, group chats, and scattered resources. By offering a simple and collaborative experience, the app helps transform wedding planning from a stressful process into an organized and enjoyable journey.
